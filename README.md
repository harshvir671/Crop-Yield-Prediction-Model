# Crop-Yield-Prediction-Model

The Crop Yield Prediction Model is a machine learning project designed to estimate crop yield based on agricultural, environmental, and soil-related parameters. Using a Kaggle dataset, the model analyzes key factors such as rainfall, temperature, fertilizer usage, and crop type to generate accurate yield predictions.

This project applies multiple ML algorithms—including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Linear Regression, and Gradient Boosting—to compare performance and select the best model. The system processes the dataset, performs feature engineering, handles missing values, and trains predictive models to understand how different variables impact crop productivity.

By evaluating model accuracy using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R², the project provides a reliable framework for supporting farmers, agronomists, and policymakers in data-driven decision-making.
